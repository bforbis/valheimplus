# ValheimPlus

This repository hosts my [ValheimPlus](https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus) server configuration.

**Supported ValheimPlus Version**: 0.9.6

### Installation Instructions

Follow the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus#installation-instructions) at the ValheimPlus github repo.

Once you have unzipped the modded contents into your game directory, you will only be able to play on ValheimPlus servers.
If you want a way to quick-switch your local game profile between "Vanilla" mode and "ValheimPlus" mode, download the [valheim-switch.bat](./valheim-switch.bat) script and run it. This script will rename your BepInEx folder in your Valheim game directory.
